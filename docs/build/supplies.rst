Supplies
========

Supplies can be separated into two categories: Consumable (plastic, motors, screws) and
non-consumable (battery charger, drill).

I also provide recommendations. None of the recommended supplies sponsor, endorse, or are
related to this project.

- 3D printer.

    - Height, width, and depth at least 200 mm.
    - TODO kg of filament.

        - PETG is preferred for good heat resistance.
        - Light colors are preferred for lower heat absorption.

- Arduino Uno.

- 2 brushless motors (3 phase AC motors).
