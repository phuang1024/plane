3D Printing
===========

Most mechanical parts are 3D printed. PETG is recommended for strength and heat resistance.
If you use PLA, the plane may melt under direct sunlight.

Settings
--------

The parts must be light and durable.

Recommended slicer settings:

- Nozzle diameter: 0.4 mm
- Layer height: 0.3 mm
- Walls (perimeters): 2
- Top and bottom: 3 layers
- Infill: 8% cubic subdivision
- Supports: Yes
- Speed: 30 mm/s
- Temperature: 250C nozzle, 80C bed.

Other
-----

Some parts are very tall, so make sure the bed adhesion is strong. You can improve it by
cleaning the bed with rubbing alcohol.
